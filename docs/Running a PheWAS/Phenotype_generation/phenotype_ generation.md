Phenotype generation has 8 scripts that we have split into:
* Data wrangling has 2 scripts
	* 01_minimum_data.R
	* 02_data_preparation.R

**and**

* Phenotypes has 6 scripts each generating a differnet type of phenotype.
	* 03a_phecode_generation.R
	* 03b_data_field_phenotypes.R
	* 03c_creating_concepts.R
	* 03d_primary_care_quantitative_phenotypes.R
	* 04_formula_phenotypes.R
	* 05_composite_phenotypes.R

We now go through each o these 2 steps in turn.
